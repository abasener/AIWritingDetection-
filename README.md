# AIWritingDetection-
Python Code to make models to predict if writing is human or Generated by an LLM.

There are 3 files:

FeaturePlots
  - Loads data and pulls features
  - It makes plots showing the distribution of each feature for the human and AI writings
  - Shows the feature values for a submitted string for testing of the features

Main
  - Has the code to load in our data and using NLTK pulls the features to run the models
  - Runs a lazy classifier to find the best models
  - Builds and trains the following models and test parameters (max_depths, layer_size, k, and more) to find the best setups
  - Models: K Nearest Nabors, Neural Network, Random Forest Light Gradient Boosting Machine

EnsembleModel
  - Runs the 4 models with their parameters found in the main and runs an ensemble method
  - There are 3 methods to make the model: Equal Vote, Summed Probabilities, and a Neural Network
